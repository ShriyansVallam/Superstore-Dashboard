# Superstore-Dashboard

# Project Background

This project focuses on creating a sales dashboard for a sample superstore. The store sells three categories of products: technology, office supplies, and furniture. My goal was to provide a general overview of performance and provide recommendations on ways to improve profit.

Insights and recommendations are provided through four key dashboards:
* Executive Dashboard: High-level trends and insights to show business performance
* Product Dashboard: Highlights how different products perform in terms of revenue, profit and order quantity
* Customer Dashboard: Highlights customer segmentation and top 100 customers
* Region Dashboard: Highlights sales metrics for each region
